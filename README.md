Movie Search and Favorites App

This is a frontend application built using Next.js that allows users to search for movies and add them to their favorites list.

It also features debounced search functionality to minimize API calls and includes a favorites section for users to view and manage their favorite movies.

Features

Search Movies: Users can type a movie title in the search bar to perform a debounced search using the OMDB API.

Movie Cards: The search results are displayed as movie cards, showing essential details such as the movie title, year of release, and an option to add/remove it from favorites using a heart icon.

Debounced Search: The application implements debounced search functionality to prevent excessive API calls while typing in the search bar.

Favorites: Users can add movies to their favorites list, which is stored in Firebase.

Favorite Icon: A filled heart icon is displayed in the movie search results if the movie is favorited.

Deployment: The application is deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.) for testing.
